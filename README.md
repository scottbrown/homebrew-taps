# homebrew-taps

Binaries for the Homebrew package manager (OSX)

## Installation

First you have to tell Homebrew about the tap.

```bash
brew tap scottbrown/homebrew-taps
```

Once that is complete, you can install any of the formulas available
in this tap (i.e.: repository).  For example:

```bash
brew install bosky
```
